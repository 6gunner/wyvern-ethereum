  << Project Wyvern Exchange >>

  Abstract trustless digital good exchange.

  Written from scratch.

*/

/*

  TODO:
    - Ability to buy/sell/auction "Ownable" assets.
    - Require hash commitments to digital items, could be revealed in dispute process out-of-band.
    - Included escrow system (maybe v2 - simple version first? - Wyvern DAO escrow?).
    - Seller must transfer out-of-band, can automatically reveal to release escrow after time delay => actually this is trustless? Can encrypt secrets to buyer... What about validity disputes? Escrow system / arbitration?
    - Think about auction format, gas price races

  Maybe: 
    - Add upgradability ("redirect all calls except core voting to address X") - will this allow new function declarations in future versions? - by set delegatecall?
